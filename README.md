## Overview

This component has a desktop and smaller screen version, with a click event for each.  The click event changes the bottom section for sharing on the small screen version and on the desktop version, it brings a pop-up share section.
(They are currently not linked to actually share)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

For this one, I started the styling myself, consulted and followed a video, didn't like the way the video was leading, chose another video, and used it, although for the final touches, I finished without the video.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

```html
Using an active class with event listeners to display different content on a click (or other event)
```
```css
Making changes in the developer tools before changing the CSS file
Working with padding and margins to fit elements together
```
```js
Using active.classList.Toggle() to display different elements on an event
```
```Github
Publishing work to Github
```

### Continued development

I'd love to make the share buttons active and learn how to code the link to open the different social media and set up a share post
